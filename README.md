# Web Scraping and API Data Extraction Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the skills acquired in extracting data from websites using web scraping techniques and requesting data from APIs. The project also involves processing the extracted data using the Pandas and Numpy libraries for further analysis.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files and directories:

- `README.md`: This readme file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `scraper.py`: Script for web scraping.
- `api_request.py`: Script for making API requests.
- `data_processing.py`: Script for processing the extracted data.
- `data/`: Directory to store the extracted data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.
- `examples/`: Examples of the extracted and processed data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the required Python packages installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Web Scraping

The `scraper.py` script is used to extract data from a specified website. To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

You can customize the URL and other parameters within the script as needed.

### API Requests

The `api_request.py` script is used to request data from a specified API. To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python api_request.py
```

Make sure to update the API endpoint and any necessary headers or parameters in the script.

### Data Processing

The `data_processing.py` script processes the extracted data using Pandas and Numpy libraries. To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python data_processing.py
```

You can modify the script to perform various data processing and analysis tasks as required.

## Data Directory

The `data/` directory is used to store the raw and processed data. Ensure that the scripts are configured to save and read data from this directory.

## Notebooks

The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis. These notebooks provide examples of how to load, process, and visualize the data.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory includes examples of the extracted and processed data. These examples serve as references for understanding the structure and format of the data.
